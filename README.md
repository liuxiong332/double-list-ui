# double-list-ui

The DoubleListUI use the `react` to construct the web component and `css-module` to stylize the UI.

It has the following characters:

- The resuable component. The user only need require this component if want to use the component.
- The embedded CSS. The user no need to worry how to operate the CSS file.
- Scoped CSS. We no need to be careful to name the css variable to prevent the potential conflict.
